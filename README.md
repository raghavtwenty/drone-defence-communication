### - WORKING
Drone Defense Communication is a real time application which is primarily focused on communication in military operations to update the situation to the other Troop members in the current operation in real time. The operation will be led by the Drone and the controller (Commander in-charge). Both of them will help the team by giving information about the enemy in advance and their location to the teams, Provide better strategy & moves to attack the enemy. This communication channel helps in team coordination & reduces the mortality rate.

### - CONCLUSION & FUTURE SCOPE
With the help of Drone Defense Communication application we are able to send messages to other troops and it can be used in real time scenarios. The packet analysis validation helps to figure out packet loss if any. Features like emergency, help and few other quick replies reduces typing time during an attack and increases efficient communication. Features like encryption, disappearing messages and other custom made options can be added in the future for better user experience.
